# Role
Act as a Senior React Frontend Developer specializing in document generation.

# Objective
Create a production-ready PDF Report Component (`SanadReportPDF`) for the "Sanad" Career Coaching application.
The PDF must be visually stunning, formatted as a professional A4 document, and strictly support **Arabic Language (RTL)** without rendering issues (disconnected letters).

# 1. Technical Stack & Setup
- **Library:** `@react-pdf/renderer` (Latest version).
- **Fonts:** You MUST use a custom Arabic font (e.g., "Cairo" or "Tajawal") to ensure glyphs render correctly. Standard fonts will fail.

# 2. Implementation Steps

## Step A: Font Registration (CRITICAL)
In the component file, register the font immediately. Assume the `.ttf` files are located in the `public/fonts/` directory.

```javascript
import { Font, Document, Page, Text, View, StyleSheet, Image } from '@react-pdf/renderer';

// Register a font that supports Arabic script
Font.register({
  family: 'Cairo',
  fonts: [
    { src: '/fonts/Cairo-Regular.ttf' },
    { src: '/fonts/Cairo-Bold.ttf', fontWeight: 'bold' }
  ]
});
Step B: Styling Strategy (The "Professional" Look)
Define a StyleSheet with these rules:

Global: fontFamily: 'Cairo', textAlign: 'right'.

RTL Handling: For containers with multiple items (like tags), use flexDirection: 'row-reverse'.

Color Palette: Use Emerald Green (#10B981) for headers/borders, and Dark Gray (#1F2937) for text.

Layout: A4 size, 30pt padding.

Step C: The Component Structure (SanadReportPDF)
The component should accept { data } as a prop (the JSON output from the AI). Render the following sections:

Header:

Top-right: "سند - مستشارك المهني" (Large Bold).

Top-left: Generation Date.

Horizontal Line separator.

Section 1: The Vocational Personality (الشخصية المهنية):

Title: "نقاط القوة والسمات".

Content: Render the strengths array as styled badges (rounded rectangles with background color), arranged in a row-reverse flex container.

Section 2: The Passion (الشغف):

Title: "المحرك الداخلي والشغف".

Content: Render the passion text field in a coherent paragraph with line-height of 1.5 for readability.

Section 3: Recommended Career Paths (المسارات المهنية):

Title: "المسارات المقترحة".

Content: A numbered list (1, 2, 3) of career_paths. Each item should be distinct and clear.

Section 4: Sanad's Golden Advice (همسة سند):

Design: A highlighted box (light green background) containing the advice text to make it stand out.

Footer:

Centered text: "This document is generated by AI based on Career Construction Theory." + Page Numbers.

Step D: The Download Trigger
Create a wrapper component DownloadReportButton that uses PDFDownloadLink.

Logic: It should only render the link when data is not null.

Button UI: A button styled with Tailwind CSS (e.g., "📄 تحميل التقرير PDF") that triggers the download.

Code Requirements
Handle edge cases: If data.strengths is missing, render a fallback text.

Ensure text wrapping is enabled for long Arabic paragraphs.
